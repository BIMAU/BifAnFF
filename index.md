Software
--------

[TransiFlow](https://github.com/BIMAU/transiflow):  Python toolbox (formerly called FVM) used to generate the results in Chapter 10. It contains the discretization of the flow problems. For the solvers one can use either solvers that go with python, or use [HYMLS](https://github.com/nlesc-smcm/hymls) (based on [Trilinos](https://trilinos.github.io/)), or solvers from [PETSc](https://petsc.org/release/). 

[BifAnFF](https://github.com/BIMAU/BifAnFF): MATLAB/Octave program by which some results in Chapters 6,7, and 8 were obtained.

Errata
-------
So far none.
