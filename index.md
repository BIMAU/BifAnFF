Software
--------
FVM
The results in Chapter 10 of the book were obtained by the python program FVM, which is freely available. The discretization of the flow problems is written in python and for the solvers one can use either solvers that go with python, or use HYMLS (based on Trilinos), or solvers from PetsC.

BifAnFF
Some results in Chapters 6,7,8 were obtained with the MATLAB/Octave program [BifAnFF](https://github.com/BIMAU/BifAnFF)
